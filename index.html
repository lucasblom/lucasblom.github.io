            <p>
              I am a 18 year old student from Switzerland. I am currently
              studying at the Kantonsschule Hottingen in ZÃ¼rich. I
              study Software Development and I am in my third year. I have
              always been interested in computers and technology. I started
              programming basic scripts in Python when I was 12 years old. Recently
              I have been learning web development and I am currently working on
              this website.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at Kantonsschule Hottingen I have been exposed to many
              different programming languages and technologies. I have worked with
              Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and many more. During these
              courses I have drastically improved my programming- and problem
              solving skills.

              In my free time I like am a active member of the Swiss Scout Movement.
              There I am a leader of a group of 9-13 year old children. I have been
              a member of the Swiss Scout Movement for 10 years now. During my time
              there I have learned many important skills such as leadership,
              teamwork, and responsibility. I have also been able to improve my
              social skills and my ability to work with others.

            I also enjoy going to the gym. I have been going to the gym for 1.5
            years now. I try to go to the gym 3-5 times a week. I enjoy going to the gym
            because it helps me stay fit and healthy. I also enjoy going to the
            gym because it helps me relieve stress and it helps me stay focused.
